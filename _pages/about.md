<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a lecturer in the team of [Zhangjie Fu](https://faculty.nuist.edu.cn/zhangjiefu/zh_CN/index.htm), [School of Computer Science](https://scs.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology](https://www.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm). I received my Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/) at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of professor [Bin Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~binli/) in 2024. I received my Bachelor’s degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My research interests mainly lie in **Artificial Intelligence Generated Content** and **AI Security**. My works focus on GANs, Diffusion, and backdoor learning of neural networks.
